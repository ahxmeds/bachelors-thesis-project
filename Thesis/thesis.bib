The predators perform independent random walks on a square lattice with V sites and start a direct chase whenever the prey appears within their sighting range. The prey is caught when a predator jumps to the site occupied by the prey. We analyze the efficacy of a lazy, minimal-effort evasion strategy according to which the prey tries to avoid encounters with the predators by making a hop only when any of the predators appears within its sighting range; otherwise the prey stays still. We show that if the sighting range of such a lazy prey is equal to 1 lattice spacing, at least 3 predators are needed in order to catch the prey on a square lattice. In this situation, we establish a simple asymptotic relation lnP ev(t) \~{} (N/V)2lnP imm(t) between the survival probabilities of an evasive and an immobile prey. Hence, when the density ρ = N/V of the predators is low, ρ << 1, the lazy evasion strategy leads to the spectacular increase of the survival probability. We also argue that a short-sighting prey (its sighting range is smaller than the sighting range of the predators) undergoes an effective superdiffusive motion, as a result of its encounters with the predators, whereas a far-sighting prey performs a diffusive-type motion.},

  abstract={We discuss search strategies for finding sources of particles transported in a random environment and detected by the searcher(s). The mixing of the particles in the environment is supposed to be strong, so that strategies based on concentration-gradient ascent are not viable. These dilute conditions are common in natural environments typical of searches performed by insects and birds. The sparseness of the detections constitutes the major stumbling block in developing efficient olfactory robots to detect mines, chemical leaks, etc. We first discuss a search strategy, 'infotaxis', recently introduced for the search of a single source by a single robot. Decisions are made by locally maximizing the rate of acquisition of information on the location of the source and they balance exploration and exploitation. We present numerical simulations demonstrating the efficiency of the method and, most importantly, its robustness to lack of detailed modeling of the transport of particles in the random environment. We then introduce a novel formulation of infotaxis for collective searches where a swarm of robots is available and must be coordinated. Gains in the search time are impressive and the method can be further generalized to deal with conflicts arising in the identification of multiple sources.}

	abstract = {Scale-free foraging patterns are widespread among animals. These may be the outcome of an optimal searching strategy to find scarce, randomly distributed resources, but a less explored alternative is that this behaviour may result from the interaction of foraging animals with a particular distribution of resources. We introduce a simple foraging model where individual primates follow mental maps and choose their displacements according to a maximum efficiency criterion, in a spatially disordered environment containing many trees with a heterogeneous size distribution. We show that a particular tree-size frequency distribution induces non-Gaussian movement patterns with multiple spatial scales (L{\'e}vy walks). These results are consistent with field observations of tree-size variation and spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) foraging patterns. We discuss the consequences that our results may have for the patterns of seed dispersal by foraging primates.},

  abstract={Random walk methods and diffusion theory pervaded ecological sciences as methods to analyze and describe animal movement. Consequently, statistical physics was mostly seen as a toolbox rather than as a conceptual framework that could contribute to theory on evolutionary biology and ecology. However, the existence of mechanistic relationships and feedbacks between behavioral processes and statistical patterns of movement suggests that, beyond movement quantification, statistical physics may prove to be an adequate framework to understand animal behavior across scales from an ecological and evolutionary perspective. Recently developed random search theory has served to critically re-evaluate classic ecological questions on animal foraging. For instance, during the last few years, there has been a growing debate on whether search behavior can include traits that improve success by optimizing random (stochastic) searches. Here, we stress the need to bring together the general encounter problem within foraging theory, as a mean for making progress in the biological understanding of random searching. By sketching the assumptions of optimal foraging theory (OFT) and by summarizing recent results on random search strategies, we pinpoint ways to extend classic OFT, and integrate the study of search strategies and its main results into the more general theory of optimal foraging.}

  abstract={Many studies on animal and human movement patterns report the existence of scaling laws and power-law distributions. Whereas a number of random walk models have been proposed to explain observations, in many situations individuals actually rely on mental maps to explore strongly heterogeneous environments. In this work, we study a model of a deterministic walker, visiting sites randomly distributed on the plane and with varying weight or attractiveness. At each step, the walker minimizes a function that depends on the distance to the next unvisited target (cost) and on the weight of that target (gain). If the target weight distribution is a power law, p ( k ) ~ k −β , in some range of the exponent β, the foraging medium induces movements that are similar to Lévy flights and are characterized by non-trivial exponents. We explore variations of the choice rule in order to test the robustness of the model and argue that the addition of noise has a limited impact on the dynamics in strongly disordered media.}

The formalism we use is based on the generalized master equation which is particularly convenient here because of its inherent coarse-graining procedure whereby a random walker position is averaged over the internal degrees of freedom. We show some instances in which non-local jump probabilities emerge from the coupling of the motion to the internal degrees of freedom, and how the tuning of one parameter can give rise to sub-, super- and normal diffusion at long times. Remarks on the relation between the generalized master equation, continuous time random walks and fractional diffusion equations are also presented.}

A large number of research papers developing fractional dynamics further, or applying it to various systems have appeared since our first review article on the fractional Fokker–Planck equation (Metzler R and Klafter J 2000a, Phys. Rep. 339 1–77). It therefore appears timely to put these new works in a cohesive perspective. In this review we cover both the theoretical modelling of sub- and superdiffusive processes, placing emphasis on superdiffusion, and the discussion of applications such as the correct formulation of boundary value problems to obtain the first passage time density function. We also discuss extensively the occurrence of anomalous dynamics in various fields ranging from nanoscale over biological to geophysical and environmental systems.}

abstract = {The feeding habits of brown trout Salmo trutta fry were studied during the critical first feeding period in a natural spawning and nursery stream. A low proportion of the fry initiated exogenous feeding before emergence from the gravel, and while having nearly 30\% of the yolk sac remaining. This probably reflected low feeding motivation or limited feeding opportunities within the gravel environment. The majority of the fry started feeding after emergence, and after most or all yolk was absorbed. Some fry emerged with large amounts of yolk remaining, while others emerged after yolk exhaustion. The degree of stomach fullness revealed that feeding was more efficient after a territory had been acquired. The diets of the young fry were dominated by chironomid larvae, followed by zooplankton and Plecoptera larvae. Fry dispersing downstream and out of the nursery area were significantly smaller than resident fry, indicating displacement due to competition for territories. The majority of the downstream dispersing fry had initiated feeding, and there was at this point no evidence of starvation in any of the fry. It therefore appeared that the later emerging fry actively migrated out of the overpopulated nursery area to find available territories further downstream.}

abstract={Context: Central Australia has been a graveyard for native mammals, with many small and medium-sized species becoming extinct or persisting in reduced geographical ranges in this region since the advent of European settlement. Species in the critical weight range (35-5500 g) have been affected most dramatically.Aims: We compared the dynamics of two geographically distant populations of a medium-sized surviving desert mammal, the brush-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus blythi, {\textasciitilde}100 g), and tested the hypothesis that this species' persistence can be explained by its demographic plasticity.Methods: Paired sampling grids, each 31.5 ha, were set up in the Tanami Desert on the northern edge of the species' geographical range and near Uluru Kata Tjuta National Park (UKTNP) on the southern boundary. Animals were live-trapped every 3 months between 1992 and 1995, and estimates made of population size, residency, reproduction, bodyweight and tail width; the latter was used as an index of condition.Key results: The UKTNP site supported a larger population of D. blythi than did the Tanami Desert site. In both areas, the population fluctuated annually, declining during the breeding season (June to October) and increasing again following the influx of juveniles in spring. Females had one litter per year, with a median and maximum litter size of six; births in the Tanami occurred in July, at least a month earlier than they did at UKTNP. Bodyweights and tail widths peaked before breeding and then declined until spring, with animals retaining better body condition in the Tanami than at UKTNP. In both regions, individuals were resident for 1-2 years; daughters remained near their mother's home range but males moved to other areas.Conclusions: The results provided little support for our initial expectation that populations of D. blythi would behave differently in disparate parts of the species' geographical range, and suggested instead that this mulgara exhibits a predictable life history, with limited demographic flexibility.Implications: The persistence of D. blythi in central Australia is most likely a result of its striking flexibility in use of food resources, its ability to enter torpor and to tolerate large declines in bodyweight and condition, and its propensity to dig deep burrows. We suggest that these attributes buffer mulgaras from the impacts of introduced predators that have contributed to extinctions of other medium-sized marsupials, and from climatic and resource uncertainties that shape the dynamics of many smaller desert mammals.},

    abstract = {Background Lévy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. Lévy walks maximise search efficiency of mobile foragers. Recently, several studies raised some concerns about the reliability of the statistical analysis used in previous analyses. Further, it is unclear whether Lévy walks represent adaptive strategies or emergent properties determined by the interaction between foragers and resource distribution. Thus two fundamental questions still need to be addressed: the presence of Lévy walks in the wild and whether or not they represent a form of adaptive behaviour.  Methodology/Principal Findings We studied 235 paths of solitary and clustered (i.e. foraging in group) fallow deer (Dama dama), exploiting the same pasture. We used maximum likelihood estimation for discriminating between a power-tailed distribution and the exponential alternative and rank/frequency plots to discriminate between Lévy walks and composite Brownian walks. We showed that solitary deer perform Lévy searches, while clustered animals did not adopt that strategy.  Conclusion/Significance Our demonstration of the presence of Lévy walks is, at our knowledge, the first available which adopts up-to-date statistical methodologies in a terrestrial mammal. Comparing solitary and clustered deer, we concluded that the Lévy walks of solitary deer represent an adaptation maximising encounter rates with forage resources and not an epiphenomenon induced by a peculiar food distribution.},

abstract={The searching trajectories of different animals can be described with a broad class of flight length (l(j)) distributions with P(l(j)) = l(j)(-m). Theoretical studies have shown that changes in these distributions (i.e., different m values) are key to optimizing the long-term encounter statistics under certain searcher-resource scenarios. In particular, they predict the advantage of L{\'e}vy searching (m [?] 2) over Brownian motion (m >= 3) for low-prey-density scenarios. Here, we present experimental evidence of predicted optimal changes in the flight-time distribution of a predator's walk in response to gradual density changes of its moving prey. Flight times of the dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina switched from an exponential to an inverse square power-law distribution when the prey (Rhodomonas sp.) decreased in abundance. Concomitantly, amplitude and frequency of the short-term helical path increased. The specific biological mechanisms involved in these searching behavioral changes are discussed. We suggest that, in a three-dimensional environment, a stronger helical component combined with a L{\'e}vy walk searching strategy enhances predator's encounter rates. Our results support the idea of universality of the statistical laws in optimal searching processes despite variations in the biological details of the organisms.},

abstract = {Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large‐scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random‐walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random‐walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Lévy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random‐walk properties (i.e., scale‐finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by‐product of locally scanning mechanisms. Lévy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super‐diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to sustain Lévy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Lévy‐modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Lévy walks. This model shows that Lévy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short‐range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the ability of performing Lévy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties.}
