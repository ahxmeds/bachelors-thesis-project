# bachelors-thesis-project
A repository containing the work I did for my bachelor's thesis project. This repository contains Arduino codes for running a phototactic robot that I developed at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systerms, IISc, Bangalore. The algorithm employed was inspired from the Levy flight foraging hypothesis. The robot alternates between the following two processes -- taking steps of length obtained from a given distribution (gaussian, levy, uniform) and turing by an angle obtained from a uniform distribution -- until it reaches a light spot at the centre of the arena. There is also a tex file containing a summary of my work under the folder "Thesis".
